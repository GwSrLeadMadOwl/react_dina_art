                    <p>My name is <strong>Dina Fomenko</strong>.<br />
                        I have a degree in graphic design at Latvian University.<br />
                        At free time I love to hang out with my friends. <br />
                        Also I never stop making progress of my artistic skills.<br />
                        Always find something new what shows my personality.<br />
                        My clients love my job. They say that my paintings are in perfect harmony with their aura.<br />
                        Something magical and fascinating.<br />
                        Maybe Iâ€™ll draw your soul as well as others saying... </p>
